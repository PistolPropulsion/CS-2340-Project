# CS-2340-Project
Project for CS 2340 at Georgia Tech

The goal for this app is for people to more easily find homeless shelters using filters since certain shelters focus on verterans while others focus on families with kids.

## What we implemented
- Google Firebase (for authentication and database of shelters)
- Google Maps
- Calling shelter right from app
